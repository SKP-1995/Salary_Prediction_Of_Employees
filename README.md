# Salary_Prediction_Of_Employees

The goal is to predict the salaries based on a rich dataset accurately for both job seekers and employers.

**Key Steps Involved**

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Conducting comprehensive EDA and unveiling valuable insights about data professionals' salaries.This involves data visualization,summary statistics and identifying patterns in the data.
2. Feature Engineering:
   Creating new features and transforming existing ones to provide additional insights/improve model performance.This involves deriving features related to experience,job role and 
   performance.
3. Data Preprocessing:
   This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing features as needed.
4. Machine Learning Model Development:
   Training various machine learning regression models to predict salaries and to find the best-performing model.
5. Model Evaluation:
   Assessing the performance of models using appropriate evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2) 
   score and to identify the model that provides the most accurate salary predictions.
6. ML Pipelines and Model Deployment:
   Creating ML Pipelines to streamline the end-to-end machine learning process from data preprocessing to model training.
   Deploying a model that can generate predictions for unseen data using Flask.
8. Recommendations:
   Providing actionable recommendations related to factors influencing salaries and potential strategies for improving earnings in data professions based on findings and insights from the 
   model.

**Dataset Overview:**
The dataset contains the following columns:
 `FIRST NAME`: First name 
 `LAST NAME`: Last name 
 `SEX`: Gender 
 `DOJ`: Date of joining the company
 `CURRENT DATE`: Current date of data
 `DESIGNATION`: Job role/designation 
 `AGE`: Age 
 `SALARY`: Target variable, the salary of the data professional
 `UNIT`: Business unit or department 
 `LEAVES USED`: Number of leaves used 
 `LEAVES REMAINING`: Number of leaves remaining 
 `RATINGS`: Ratings or performance ratings 
 `PAST EXP`: Past work experience
